    "splashScreen.helpDrawer.item.overlap.description": "Curved shapes are approximated with line segments. For a more accurate nest with curved parts, decrease the curve tolerance parameter in the configuration.",

    "splashScreen.helpDrawer.item.svg.description": "Nesting only works for closed shapes, so SVG elements that don't represent closed shapes are removed. Convert text and any other elements to outlines first. Ensure that outlines do not intersect or overlap eachother. Outlines that are inside other outlines are considered holes.",

    "splashScreen.helpDrawer.item.mesure.description": "SVG has its internal units, the distance related fields in the settings use SVG units, ie. pixels. The conversion between a pixel and real units depend on the exporting software, but it's typically 72 pixels = 1 inch.",

    "splashScreen.helpDrawer.item.nesting.description": "If you have some parts to cut out of a piece of metal/plastic/wood etc, you'd want to arrange the parts to use as little material as possible. This is a common problem if you use a laser cutter, plasma cutter, or CNC machine.In computer terms this is called the irregular bin-packing problem.",
